//! An RLE-like 2-bit greyscale image decoder used for displaying the
//! Oro logo in the kernel.
//!
//! The first "frame" is the base image data. It is draw once at the
//! very start of the sequence. At the end of the sequence, drawing is
//! looped back around to the second frame (offset 1), if it exists.
//!
//! Note that this usually means the first frame is re-encoded at the
//! end of the sequence to have a clean transition back to the second
//! frame.
//!
//! A sequence is one or more frames, one directly after the other.
//! Each frame is a series of one or more commands, always ending with
//! a Skip(u15::MAX) command.
//!
//! All commands are 16 bits. Bit 0 indicates the command - either
//! draw (HIGH) or skip (LOW). When drawing, bits 1 and 2 indicate
//! the intensity, bit 2 being the MSB. The remaining 13 bits are
//! the **pixel count**. When skipping, the remaining 15 bits are
//! the **pixel count** to skip (as in, do not alter the pixel color
//! at all).
//!
//! Skip words with a count of 0 are "end markers". Correlary, if
//! the "raw" u16 == 0x0000, then it's the "end frame" marker.
//!
//! Finally, the entire payload is bzip2 compressed (check build.rs
//! for exact parameters).
//!

/// a memory safe language, such as Rust, or performing the checks each
/// time). This is because these commands could possibly do arbitrary
/// memory execution with a malicious payload in memory under the right
/// circumstances (well, strange circumstances... someone would have to
/// load a custom version of the Oro logo, run it through the RLE, and
/// simultaneously not trust the source of the logo but trust the source
/// of the kernel - if you don't trust the kernel itself, all bets are
/// off to begin with).

/// Under normal circumstances, following each command issued by the
/// iterator, in order, for each frame, without resetting the iterator
/// (which itself never resets), *should* result in a well-formed logo
/// display with minimal processing/size overhead. In the event the target
/// buffer is resized or needs to be repainted, you'll have to re-iterate
